# CS50AI — Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

A complete collection of my projects, problem sets, and exercises from **Harvard’s CS50: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**.  
This repository documents hands-on implementations of AI concepts — from search and logic to machine learning and reinforcement learning — all written and tested in Python.

---

## Overview

This repo contains my personal solutions and experiments for the CS50 AI curriculum.  
Each folder corresponds to a course module / week and includes:
- formal problem set solutions,
- helper scripts and notebooks (where applicable),
- short notes or README for each assignment.

All code was developed and tested in a CS50-compatible environment (CS50 IDE / Duck) and standard Python toolkits.
